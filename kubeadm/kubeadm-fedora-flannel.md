# KubeAdm based kubernetes cluster

Reference documentation:[https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/install-kubeadm/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/install-kubeadm/)

Kubeadm helps you setup/bootstrap a minimum viable/usable Kubernetes cluster that just works. Kubeadm also supports cluster expansion, upgrades, downgrade, and managing bootstrap tokens, which are extra features, if you are comparing it with minikube.

A video showing kubeadm cluster setup, (in Urdu language), using this guide, is available at: [https://youtu.be/FRvkSlIUimM](https://youtu.be/FRvkSlIUimM)


## Setup / components / look and feel:
The Kubernetes cluster discussed in this guide is a virtual cluster, created using virtual machines running on KVM/Libvirt, on a Fedora 28 host computer.

## Features and Limitations:
* Possible to create multi-node kubernetes cluster compared to minikube.
* It creates a single node master. No High Availability for master node available yet.
* You can create/join one or more **dedicated** worker-nodes.
* Being multi-node in nature, allows you to use multi-node features such as [advance scheduling policies](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2017/03/advanced-scheduling-in-kubernetes/).
* Services of type **LoadBalancer** still not possible
* Choice of using different container engines, such as Docker, Rocket, etc. This is not possible in MiniKube.
* Choice of wide variety of (CNI-based) network plugins to be used for pod networking. This is not possible in MiniKube.
* Supports cluster expansion, upgrades, downgrade, etc.
* *Can* be used as a production cluster, though extreme caution is advised. You should know what you are doing!


In this guide, I will setup a single node kubernetes cluster using **kubeadm** and Docker-CE. Once installed, I will add more nodes to the cluster - again using **kubeadm**.


## Preparation:
* **RAM:** Minimum 1 GB RAM for each node (master+worker); you will only be able to run very few (and very small) containers, like nginx, mysql, etc.
* **CPU:** Minimum 2 CPU for master node; worker nodes can live with single core CPUs
* **Disk:** 4 GB for host OS + 20 GB for storing container images. (no swap)
* **Network - Infrastructure:** A functional virtual/physical network with some usable IP addresses (can be public or private) . This can be on any cloud provider as well. You are free to use any network / ip scheme for yourself. In this guide, it will be `10.240.0.0/24`
* **Network - Pod network:** A network IP range completely separate from other two networks, with subnet mask of `/16` or smaller (e.g. `/12`). This network will be subdivided into subnets later. In this guide it will be `10.200.0.0/16` . Please note that kubeadm does not support kubenet, so we need to use one of the CNI add-ons - such as flannel. By default Flannel sets up a pod network `10.244.0.0/16`, which means that we need to pass this pod network to `kubeadm init` (further below); or, modify the flannel configuration with the pod network of our own choice - before actually applying it blindly. :)
* **Network - Service network:** A network IP range completely separate from other two networks, used by the services. This will be considered a completely virtual network. The default service network configured by kubeadm is `10.96.0.0/12`. In this guide, it will be `10.32.0.0/16`.
* **Firewall:** Disable Firewall (including removing the firewalld package), or open the following ports on each type of node, after the OS installation is complete. 
* **Firewall/ports - Master:** Incoming open (22, 6443, 10250, 10251, 10252, 2379, 2380)
* **Firewall/ports - Worker:** Incoming open (22, 10250, 30000-32767)
* **OS:** Any recent version of Fedora/CentOS/RHEL or Debian based OS. This guide uses Fedora 28
* **Disk Partitioning:** No swap - must disable swap partition during OS installation in order for the kubelet to work properly. See: [https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/53533](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/53533) for details on why disable swap. Swap may seem a good idea, it is not - on Kubernetes!
* **SELinux:** Disable SELinux / App Armour.
* Should have some sort of DNS for infrastructure network.

## OS setup:

```
[root@kworkhorse lib]# cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain

 # Virtual Kubernetes cluster
10.240.0.31	kubeadm-node1
10.240.0.32	kubeadm-node2
10.240.0.33	kubeadm-node3
```

```
sudo yum -y remove firewalld

sudo yum -y install ebtables
```

Enable the sysctl setting `net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables`
```
cat <<EOF >  /etc/sysctl.d/k8s.conf
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1
EOF
sysctl --system
```



### Install container runtime (Docker):
Reference: [https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/cri/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/cri/)
You can select other runtimes too, such as Rocket (rkt). I will use Docker.

**Note:** DO NOT install docker from default Fedora/CentOS repository, that is a very old version of Docker.

On all nodes (master+worker), install Docker.
```
sudo dnf config-manager \
    --add-repo \
    https://download.docker.com/linux/fedora/docker-ce.repo
```


```
sudo dnf install docker-ce
```

```
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl status docker
```

### Install kubeadm, kubelet and kubectl:
On each node, install:
* kubeadm: the command to actually setup / bootstrap the cluster.
* kubelet: the component that runs on all of the machines in your cluster and does things like starting pods and containers.
* kubectl: the command line util to talk to your cluster.


All of the above three pieces of software are available from kubernetes's yum repository. So first, set that up:

```
cat <<EOF > /etc/yum.repos.d/kubernetes.repo
[kubernetes]
name=Kubernetes
baseurl=https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/repos/kubernetes-el7-x86_64
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
repo_gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/doc/yum-key.gpg https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/doc/rpm-package-key.gpg
exclude=kube*
EOF
```

```
sudo sed -i 's/^SELINUX=enforcing$/SELINUX=disabled/' /etc/selinux/config
```

```
yum install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl --disableexcludes=kubernetes

systemctl enable kubelet && systemctl start kubelet
```

The above command installs additional packages, which are:
* cri-tools  (command line utility to interact with container runtime, such as docker)
* kubernetes-cni (binary files to provision container networking. The files are installed in `/opt/cni/bin`)
* socat  (relay for bidirectional data transfer between two independent data channels, e.g. files, pipe, device, socket, program, etc.)


At this time kubeadm is only *installed* - not *run*. Note that kubelet is set to start. Kubelet will continuously try to start and will fail (crash-loop), because it will wait for kubeadm to tell it what to do. This crashloop is expected and normal. After you initialize your master (using kubeadm), the kubelet runs normally.


## Run kubeadm on node1/master to setup the cluster:

SSH to the master node (node1) - as root, and run `kubeadm init` command. Also make a note of entire output of the `kubeadm init` command. This will be useful later. 

What `kubeadm init` does is, it goes through a series of phases, the first one being **pre-flight checks** , and last one being **installing add-ons**. These phases are shown in square brackets in the beginning of each line of the output generated by the `kubeadm init` command. Most notably, these phases are:

* Pull container images for kubernetes *control plane* (etcd, API server, Controller Manager, Scheduler)
* Setup kublet as systemd service
* Generate self signed SSL certificates for all kubernetes components
* Generate necessary kubeconfig files for components of the *control plane*, and the admin user, to be able to access API server with credentials, certificates, etc
* Create and deploy **static pod** definitions of the *control plane* components directly through **kubelet**. You will see (later) that etcd, api-server, controller-manager and scheduler are deployed as plain pods, without being part of any replication-controller, deployment, or daemon-set. These pods are setup using *host* networking.
* Create **kubelet** configuration as *config-map* in the **kube-system** namespace - as soon as the control plane boots up and reports healthy
* Mark the master as **master**  by adding labels and taints
* Create bootstrap tokens and RBAC rules so various components are able to access each other and do certain things, like automatic approval of CSRs, etc
* Install CoreDNS addon by creating it as a *deployment* - using *pod* networking
* Install kube-proxy addon by creating it as a *daemon-set* - using *host* networking

Complete detail of all these phases can be found here: [https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/implementation-details/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/implementation-details/)


OK, enought talk! Lets initialize kubeadm!

```
kubeadm init \
  --pod-network-cidr "10.200.0.0/16" \
  --service-cidr "10.32.0.0/16"
```

**Note:** You can skip `--pod-network-cidr` and `--service-cidr` . The default for pod-network is nothing- actually depends on the CNI plugin you will be using; but if you plan to use flannel, **and** want to use flannels *default configuration*, then you must pass `--pod-network-cidr "10.244.0.0/16"` to the `kubeadm init` command . The default for `--service-cidr` is: `10.96.0.0/12`. 



So the first attempt results in the following:
```
[root@kubeadm-node1 ~]# kubeadm init \
>   --pod-network-cidr "10.200.0.0/16" \
>   --service-cidr "10.32.0.0/16"

Of-course I installed the latest docker-ce from the docker repository.

```
[root@kubeadm-node1 ~]# yum list docker-ce

```

And, I have the following version for kubeadm:

```
[root@kubeadm-node1 ~]# kubeadm version
kubeadm version: &version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"12", GitVersion:"v1.12.2", GitCommit:"17c77c7898218073f14c8d573582e8d2313dc740", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2018-10-24T06:51:33Z", GoVersion:"go1.10.4", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}

I can downgrade docker to 18.06 , which is certified with kubeadm, but I can try to use docker 18.09 by asking kubeadm to skip this test.

```
[root@kubeadm-node1 ~]# kubeadm init  \

Your Kubernetes master has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of machines by running the following on each node
as root:

  kubeadm join 10.240.0.31:6443 --token wmrvvj.3kmknfziy308ia0o --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:0e659353306c04c46295868b407d4eae754d91de2e0f19a852eda7de17cbe3a5

[root@kubeadm-node1 ~]# 
```


Now we setup the user `student` to use kubectl. This is part of the instructions in the `kubeadmin init` output above.

```
[root@kubeadm-node1 ~]# su - student

[student@kubeadm-node1 ~]$ mkdir -p $HOME/.kube

[student@kubeadm-node1 ~]$ sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

[sudo] password for student: 

[student@kubeadm-node1 ~]$ sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```

Check if you can talk to the cluster/API server:

```
[student@kubeadm-node1 ~]$ kubectl get componentstatuses
NAME                 STATUS    MESSAGE              ERROR
scheduler            Healthy   ok                   
controller-manager   Healthy   ok                   
etcd-0               Healthy   {"health": "true"}   
[student@kubeadm-node1 ~]$ 


[student@kubeadm-node1 ~]$ kubectl get nodes
NAME            STATUS     ROLES    AGE   VERSION
kubeadm-node1   NotReady   master   12m   v1.12.2
[student@kubeadm-node1 ~]$ 
```

At least the cluster's components are ok!

# Install pod network:
At this time, if you check cluster health, you will see **Master** as **NotReady**. It is because a pod network is not yet deployed on the cluster. You must install a pod network add-on so that your pods can communicate with each other. Use one of the network addons listed in the Networking section at [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/). Flannel is the easiest. Others can be used too.

**Important:** The network must be deployed before any applications. Also, CoreDNS will not start up before a network is installed. kubeadm only supports Container Network Interface (CNI) based networks (and does not support kubenet).

**Repeat: Kubeadm DOES NOT support kubenet** 


## Install flannel CNI plugin/addon:
**Note:** For flannel to work correctly, you must pass `--pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16` to `kubeadm init` ; or modify the kube-flannel.yaml to use your own pod network before applying tha yaml with `kubectl`. 

Also, set `/proc/sys/net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-iptables` to `1` by running `sysctl net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1` to pass bridged IPv4 traffic to iptables’ chains. This is a requirement for some CNI plugins to work. Setup this configuration in the `/etc/sysctl.conf` file to make this permanent.

Check [https://github.com/coreos/flannel/blob/master/Documentation/kubernetes.md](https://github.com/coreos/flannel/blob/master/Documentation/kubernetes.md) for more information about flannel.

Download the flannel.yaml file and adjust the pod network with the one we chose (10.200.0.0/16) 

```
[student@kubeadm-node1 ~]$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/flannel/master/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml
--2018-11-11 22:05:05--  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/flannel/master/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml

Saving to: ‘kube-flannel.yml’

2018-11-11 22:05:06 (234 KB/s) - ‘kube-flannel.yml’ saved [10599/10599]

[student@kubeadm-node1 ~]$ grep 10.244 kube-flannel.yml 
      "Network": "10.244.0.0/16",
[student@kubeadm-node1 ~]$ 

[student@kubeadm-node1 ~]$ sed -i 's/10\.244/10\.200/g' kube-flannel.yml 

[student@kubeadm-node1 ~]$ grep 10.244 kube-flannel.yml 
(no output, means no-match, good!)

[student@kubeadm-node1 ~]$ grep 10.200 kube-flannel.yml 
      "Network": "10.200.0.0/16",
[student@kubeadm-node1 ~]$ 

(good!)
```



Now, apply this yaml file to the cluster, so the pod network could come up. Flannel is setup as a *daemon-set* and uses *host* networking of the node.

```
[student@kubeadm-node1 ~]$ kubectl apply -f kube-flannel.yml

Let's see if we can run a simple nginx container, in the `default` namespace. (You do not need to explicitly mention default in the command line - duh!)

```
[student@kubeadm-node1 ~]$ kubectl run nginx --image=nginx:alpine
kubectl run --generator=deployment/apps.v1beta1 is DEPRECATED and will be removed in a future version. Use kubectl create instead.
deployment.apps/nginx created
[student@kubeadm-node1 ~]$ 
```

It's status is **Pending**, not **Creating Container**, nor **CrashLooping** . 
```
[student@kubeadm-node1 ~]$ kubectl get pods
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-64d9675947-tr5mk   0/1     Pending   0          50s
[student@kubeadm-node1 ~]$ 
```

The reason for nginx container being pending is that our Node1 is actually master node, and it has a **taint** set to **NoSchedule** . You can check for it using the `kubectl describe node` command:

```
[student@kubeadm-node1 ~]$ kubectl describe node kubeadm-node1 | grep Taints
Taints:             node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule
[student@kubeadm-node1 ~]$ 
```

At this point, we have two options. Either remove the taint from this node, or setup another node and make it join the cluster. As soon as a new (worker) node is added to the cluster, the pod will be assigned to the worker node, and it will start on the new node.


If you want to be able to schedule pods on the master, e.g. for a single-machine Kubernetes cluster for experimenting/testing/development , run the following command to remove the specific taint from all the (existing/cluster) nodes:

```
kubectl taint nodes --all node-role.kubernetes.io/master-
```

After this is applied, pods will/can be scheduled on master node too. There is another way of running pods on master node, by setting *toleration* in the yaml file that creates a pod/deployment/etc, but that is beyond the scope of installing the cluster. 

Since this guide is about running a multi-node kubeadm based kubernetes cluster, we will simply add another node to the cluster.


# Add / join a node:

To join a new node to the cluster, you need to satisfy the following conditions first:
* You have SSH / root access to the node
* You have already setup a container runtime, such as Docker on it, and it is in working order
* You have downloaded and installed kubeadm, kubelet and kubectl on it

When you executed `kubeadm init`, you were given a command to run on the nodes you want to join to this cluster. 

```
You can now join any number of machines by running the following on each node
as root:

  kubeadm join 10.240.0.31:6443 --token wmrvvj.3kmknfziy308ia0o --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:0e659353306c04c46295868b407d4eae754d91de2e0f19a852eda7de17cbe3a5
```

So we can do that now. Please note that the token is only valid for 24 hours after the initialization of the cluster. If you are trying to join a node to the cluster after 24 hours have passed, you need to generate a new token. That can be done simply by running `kubeadm token create` on the master node. Then use the new token in the `kubeadm join` command.


```

**Note:** I appended `--ignore-preflight-errors="SystemVerification"` to the `kubeadm join` command, becaue my first run without this command resulted in an error. It was simply kubeadm was not recognising the latest Docker-ce 18.09 . By this time of writing, kubeadm is only certified to work with docker-ce 18.06 . So I had to skip that test. Here is the error just for completion's sake:

[root@kubeadm-node2 ~]# 
```

If you check the list of nodes now, you should be able to see node2 too.

```
[student@kubeadm-node1 ~]$ kubectl get nodes

```


At this time, the scheduler should have automatically assigned nginx pod to  node2.

```
[student@kubeadm-node1 ~]$ kubectl get pods

Hurray! It works!

# Accessing your cluster from machines other than the master node:

So far, we are able to talk to our Kubernetes cluster from node1, as user student. It is because that is where we have configured our `.kube/config` which is used by `kubectl` commands. To be able to access the cluster from some other computer, such as your work computer, etc, you need to copy the administrator kubeconfig file from your master node to your computer like this:

```
mkdir ~/.kube
scp student@<master-node-ip>:/home/student/.kube/config  ~/.kube/kubeadm-cluster.conf
kubectl --kubeconfig ~/.kube/kubeadm-cluster.conf get nodes
```

It might be a hassle to include `--kubeconfig ~/.kube/kubeadm-cluster.conf` in every kubectl command. You can setup a shell alias, or you can simply save it as `~/.kube/config` on your work computer. **WARNING** However, it is possible that you already have `~/.kube/config` file, which might contain configuration to one or more existing kubernetes clusters, and you don't want to accidently lose access to those clusters by over-writing it with this `.kube/config` . To be able to retain access to those clusters, and still also be able to use this kubeadm cluster, all from single kubectl, without specifying `--kubeconfig` everytime, you can use the KUBECONFIG environment variable. 

Lets start at master node, where we have a working copy of our `.kube/config` file.
First, we need to fix the default config we got from kubeadm. It is not very helpful in identifying which cluster is it. e.g. look at the following information. It looks very vague:

```
[student@kubeadm-node1 ~]$ kubectl config current-context
kubernetes-admin@kubernetes

[student@kubeadm-node1 ~]$ kubectl config get-clusters
NAME
kubernetes
[student@kubeadm-node1 ~]$
```

With a little `sed` , I changed the `.kube/config` for the student user. 


```
[student@kubeadm-node1 tmp]$ sed -i 's/kubernetes-admin/kubeadm-admin/g' $HOME/.kube/config

[student@kubeadm-node1 tmp]$ sed -i 's/kubernetes/kubeadm-cluster/g' $HOME/.kube/config
```


It now looks like the following:

```
[student@kubeadm-node1 ~]$ kubectl config current-context
kubeadm-admin@kubeadm-cluster

[student@kubeadm-node1 ~]$ kubectl config get-clusters
NAME
kubeadm-cluster
[student@kubeadm-node1 ~]$ 
```

Verify that it works:

```
[student@kubeadm-node1 ~]$ kubectl get pods
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-64d9675947-nw4kl   1/1     Running   0          3m53s
[student@kubeadm-node1 ~]$ 
```



Now, I copy this file from the master node to my work computer, inside `~/.kube/` directory, saving it as `kubeadm-cluster.conf`. 

```
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ scp student@kubeadm-node1:/home/student/.kube/config .kube/kubeadm-cluster.conf
config                                                                                                100% 5455     5.4MB/s   00:00    
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ 
```

I verify once that it works:

```
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ kubectl --kubeconfig=$HOME/.kube/kubeadm-cluster.conf  get pods
NAME                     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-64d9675947-nw4kl   1/1       Running   0          11m
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$
```

Notice that my default .kube/config lists two clusters, one of them is production cluster for a client. I don't want to lose this configuration. 

```
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ kubectl config get-contexts
CURRENT   NAME                    CLUSTER                 AUTHINFO   NAMESPACE
*         minikube                minikube                minikube   
          client-gce.k8s.local   client-gce.k8s.local   admin      
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ 
```

So I have verified that without using `--kubeconfig` with `kubectl`, I can access my previous clusters. By using a specific configuration with `--kubeconfig` , I can access my kubeadm cluster. Is it possible to merge these two configurations? No. Not directly, which is actually a safety feature. Check this article for more detail: [https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/#set-the-kubeconfig-environment-variable](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/#set-the-kubeconfig-environment-variable) .

I will solve it by using the KUBECONFIG environment variable as described in the above link. Here is how:

```
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ export KUBECONFIG=$KUBECONFIG:$HOME/.kube/config:$HOME/.kube/kubeadm-cluster.conf

[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ kubectl config get-clusters
NAME
minikube
client-gce.k8s.local
kubeadm-cluster
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ 
```

If I do a `get-contexts`  or `get-clusters` now, I get all three clusters! Now, I can simply switch context and use my kubeadm-cluster, without using the `--kubeconfig=...` with each of my `kubectl` command.

```
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ kubectl config use-context kubeadm-admin@kubeadm-cluster
Switched to context "kubeadm-admin@kubeadm-cluster".


[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ kubectl config get-contexts
CURRENT   NAME                            CLUSTER                 AUTHINFO        NAMESPACE
*         kubeadm-admin@kubeadm-cluster   kubeadm-cluster         kubeadm-admin   
          minikube                        minikube                minikube        
          client-gce.k8s.local           client-gce.k8s.local   admin           
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$
```


```
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ kubectl get pods
NAME                     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-64d9675947-nw4kl   1/1       Running   0          20m
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ 
```

Hurray! It works!


Now, I just need to setup this `KUBECONFIG` permanently in my `.bash_profile` file so I don't have to do this every time I login to my computer. Depending on your situation and the way you start your session on your work computer, you may want to add this to any/all of:
* `/etc/profile`  (login shell)
* `~/.bash_profile` (login shell)
* `~/.bash_login` (login shell)
* `~/.profile` (login shell)
* `/etc/bash.bashrc` (non-login shell)
* `~/.bashrc` (non-login shell)

```
[kamran@kworkhorse ~]$ vi .bash_profile 

. . . 

PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/bin

KUBECONFIG=$KUBECONFIG:$HOME/.kube/config:$HOME/.kube/kubeadm-cluster.conf

export PATH KUBECONFIG
```


**Note:**
The `admin.conf` file (`/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf` on master node, copied as `/home/student/.kube/config`) gives the user superuser privileges over the cluster. This file should be used very carefully. For normal users, it’s recommended to generate an unique credential, to which you whitelist privileges. You can do this with the `kubeadm alpha phase kubeconfig user --client-name <client-name>` command. This command will print out a KubeConfig file to STDOUT which you should save to a file and distribute to your user. After that, whitelist privileges by using `kubectl create (cluster)rolebinding`.
